### 3.1 What separates the three pastes in the mid-infrared

The mean spectra of the three pastes are dominated by the same lipid bands (Fig. 1a): the olefinic
=C–H stretch near 3008 cm<sup>−1</sup>, the CH<sub>2</sub> stretches at 2922 and 2853 cm<sup>−1</sup>, the ester carbonyl near
1745 cm<sup>−1</sup>, the CH<sub>2</sub> scissoring near 1463 cm<sup>−1</sup>, the ester C–O stretches around 1160 cm<sup>−1</sup> and the CH<sub>2</sub>
rocking band near 721 cm<sup>−1</sup>.[@guillen1997] The protein of the seeds adds the amide I and amide II bands
near 1650 and 1540 cm<sup>−1</sup>.[@barth2007] Adulteration therefore changes the relative intensity of bands
that all three pastes share. After SNV, pure sunflower paste differs from authentic tahini mainly by
weaker CH<sub>2</sub> stretching (−0.29 and −0.22 SNV units at 2920 and 2851 cm<sup>−1</sup>) and stronger absorption at
989 and 1051 cm<sup>−1</sup> (+0.25 and +0.20), the region of C–O stretching in carbohydrates,[@kacurakova2001]
and below 700 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Pure peanut paste differs in the opposite direction: stronger CH<sub>2</sub> stretching
(+0.64 and +0.50 at 2920 and 2853 cm<sup>−1</sup>) and ester carbonyl (+0.21 at 1749 cm<sup>−1</sup>), and weaker amide I
(−0.29 at 1655 cm<sup>−1</sup>) and carbohydrate C–O bands (−0.21 to −0.28 between 1041 and 1132 cm<sup>−1</sup>). Relative
to tahini, then, the sunflower paste carries less lipid signal and the peanut paste more, which is
why the two adulterants pull the spectrum in different directions and can be told apart.

Most of the information that distinguishes one physical sample from another lies in the two regions
given to the models. The median ratio of between-sample to within-sample variance was 5.0 over
600–1800 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 7.4 over 2800–3050 cm<sup>−1</sup>, against 2.6 in the CO<sub>2</sub> band and 2.6 in the water-vapour
region (Fig. 1b). Within-sample variance is not small anywhere: replicate scans of one sample,
repositioned on the crystal, differ appreciably, and this is the variation that a scan-level split
lets the model see on both sides.
